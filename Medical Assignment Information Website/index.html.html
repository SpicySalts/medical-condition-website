    <h2 id="SubTitle">What is asthma?</h2>
    <p>Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath.
        For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack.  
        Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed.</p>

    <h2 id="SubTitle">Symptoms of asthma:</h2>
    <p>Asthma symptoms vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe. Some individuals may experience infrequent asthma attacks, while others may have persistent symptoms that interfere with daily activities. In some cases, asthma symptoms only appear in response to specific triggers, such as physical exertion, exposure to allergens, or changes in weather conditions. Others may struggle with asthma symptoms regularly, requiring ongoing management and treatment. Recognizing the patterns of symptoms and identifying personal triggers can help individuals better control their condition and improve their quality of life.</p>

    <h2 id="SubTitle">Treatment:</h2>
    <p>What Are the Different Types of Asthma Medicines and Treatments?
        There are four types of asthma medicines and treatments:
        The first is Quick-relief medicines. These medicines work quickly to relieve sudden symptoms. You take them as needed and at the first sign of symptoms. An example would be a <span class="SpecialWord">inhaler</span>.
        The second being Controller medicines. These medicines help control asthma by correcting the underlying changes in the airways, such as swelling and excess mucus. They can be one or a combination of medicines.
        The third being a Combination of quick-relief and controller medicines. These medicines are used for both short-term relief and control. (They are recommended in the current asthma clinical guidelines, but they have not yet been approved to be used in this way by the FDA.)
        And finally, Biologics. This type of treatment targets a cell or protein to prevent swelling inside the airways. They are for people with certain types of persistent asthma and are given by injection or infusion.
        The difference between these asthma treatments can be confusing. It is important to understand what each treatment does and how they help your asthma. Learning how to use each correctly can you help keep your asthma well-controlled. Always take your medicines as directed by your doctor and follow your Asthma Action Plan.</p>
